# Employee Active Status Update Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that when users are deactivated or reactivated, the corresponding employee document's `isActive` field is automatically updated to maintain data consistency across the system.

## Problem Solved
Previously, when deactivating/reactivating users through the `/api/users/deactivate` and `/api/users/reactivate` endpoints, only the `users` collection was being updated. The employee documents in the enterprise departments subcollections were not being synchronized, leading to inconsistent data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `updateEmployeeActiveStatus` Helper Function

**Location:** `controllers/userController.js` (lines 20-152)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Robust Employee Reference Handling**: Works with both stored `employeeRef` and dynamically searches for employee documents
- **Multiple Search Strategies**: 
  - Primary: Uses stored `employeeRef` from user document
  - Fallback 1: Direct access using `userId` as document ID (new structure)
  - Fallback 2: Query by `userId` field (legacy structure)
- **Document Verification**: Confirms employee document exists before updating
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Automatic Reference Updates**: Updates user's `employeeRef` if missing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with detailed error reporting

### 2. Integration Points

**Deactivation Function** (`deactivateUser`):
- Line 1546: Calls `updateEmployeeActiveStatus(userId, false, 'deactivation')`
- Updates employee `isActive` to `false`
- Adds `deactivationAt` timestamp to employee document

**Reactivation Function** (`reactivateUser`):
- Line 1750: Calls `updateEmployeeActiveStatus(userId, true, 'reactivation')`
- Updates employee `isActive` to `true`
- Adds `reactivationAt` timestamp to employee document

### 3. Enhanced Activity Logging

Both deactivation and reactivation functions now log detailed information about employee updates:
- Employee update success/failure status
- Previous and new employee status values
- Employee document reference path
- Update reason (if skipped)

## Database Structure Handled

### User Document
```javascript
{
  "active": true/false,           // User account status
  "enterpriseRef": DocumentReference,
  "employeeRef": DocumentReference, // May be missing in some cases
  "deactivatedAt": Timestamp,     // Added on deactivation
  "reactivatedAt": Timestamp      // Added on reactivation
}
```

### Employee Document
```javascript
{
  "isActive": true/false,         // Employee status (synced with user.active)
  "updatedAt": Timestamp,
  "deactivationAt": Timestamp,    // Added on deactivation
  "reactivationAt": Timestamp     // Added on reactivation
}
```

## API Endpoints Affected

### POST `/api/users/deactivate`
**Request:**
```javascript
{
  "active": false,
  "targetUserId": "optional_user_id" // For admin operations
}
```

**Response includes employee update status:**
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User account deactivated successfully",
  "data": {
    "userId": "user_id",
    "active": false,
    "deactivatedAt": "2025-01-23T...",
    "operationType": "self_deactivation" // or "admin_deactivation"
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/users/reactivate`
**Request:**
```javascript
{
  "active": true,
  "targetUserId": "optional_user_id" // For admin operations
}
```

**Response includes employee update status:**
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User account reactivated successfully",
  "data": {
    "userId": "user_id",
    "active": true,
    "reactivatedAt": "2025-01-23T...",
    "operationType": "self_reactivation" // or "admin_reactivation"
  }
}
```

## Logging and Monitoring

### Console Logs
The implementation provides detailed console logging:
```
[UpdateEmployeeActive] üîç Updating employee active status for user: {userId}
[UpdateEmployeeActive] üìù New isActive status: {isActive}
[UpdateEmployeeActive] üè¢ Enterprise ID: {enterpriseId}
[UpdateEmployeeActive] üë§ Employee reference: {employeeRef.path}
[UpdateEmployeeActive] ‚úÖ Successfully updated employee active status to: {isActive}
[UpdateEmployeeActive] üìä Employee status changed from {previous} to {new}
```

### Activity Logs
Enhanced activity logging includes:
- `employeeUpdated`: Boolean indicating if employee was updated
- `employeeRef`: Path to employee document
- `employeePreviousStatus`: Previous `isActive` value
- `employeeNewStatus`: New `isActive` value
- `employeeUpdateSuccess`: Whether employee update succeeded
- `employeeUpdateReason`: Reason if update was skipped

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- If employee update fails, user deactivation/reactivation still succeeds
- Errors are logged but don't block the main operation
- Detailed error messages for debugging

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Missing Employee Reference**: Function searches for employee document
2. **Employee Document Not Found**: Operation continues with warning log
3. **Permission Errors**: Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
4. **Non-Enterprise Users**: Skips employee update with appropriate logging

## Testing

### Test Script: `test-employee-active-simple.js`
- Finds enterprise employee for testing
- Tests deactivation: Verifies both user and employee status = false
- Tests reactivation: Verifies both user and employee status = true
- Provides comprehensive test results

**Run Test:**
```bash
node test-employee-active-simple.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üöÄ Testing Employee Active Status Sync...
üìã Test user: user@example.com (userId)
üìç Employee path: enterprise/.../employees/userId
üìä Initial employee isActive: true

üîÑ Testing deactivation...
   User active: false ‚úÖ
   Employee isActive: false ‚úÖ

üîÑ Testing reactivation...
   User active: true ‚úÖ
   Employee isActive: true ‚úÖ

üìä RESULTS:
   Deactivation sync: ‚úÖ PASS
   Reactivation sync: ‚úÖ PASS
   Overall: ‚úÖ SUCCESS

üéâ Employee isActive field properly syncs with user active status!
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: User and employee statuses are always synchronized
2. **Robustness**: Handles multiple employee document structures and edge cases
3. **Visibility**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Works with both old and new employee document structures
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of errors without blocking main operations
6. **Admin Support**: Works for both self-operations and admin operations on other users

## Future Considerations

1. **Batch Operations**: Consider implementing batch user deactivation with employee sync
2. **Performance**: Monitor performance impact for enterprises with many employees
3. **Audit Trail**: Consider adding more detailed audit trails for compliance
4. **Notification System**: Could trigger notifications when employees are deactivated/reactivated

## Files Modified

1. **`controllers/userController.js`**: Enhanced `updateEmployeeActiveStatus` function and integration
2. **`test-employee-active-simple.js`**: Test script to verify functionality
3. **`EMPLOYEE_ACTIVE_UPDATE_README.md`**: This documentation file
