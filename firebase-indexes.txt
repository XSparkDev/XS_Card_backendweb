# Required Firestore Indexes for XS Card Backend

The activity log search functionality requires several composite indexes to function properly.
Follow these steps to create the necessary indexes:

1. Open the Firestore Console
   Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/xscard-addd4/firestore/indexes

2. Create the following composite indexes for the "activityLogs" collection: 

   ## For action-based queries:
   - Fields:
     * action (Ascending)
     * timestamp (Descending)
   - Collection Group: activityLogs
   - Query scope: Collection

   ## For resource-based queries: 
   - Fields:
     * resource (Ascending)
     * timestamp (Descending)
   - Collection Group: activityLogs
   - Query scope: Collection

   ## For user-based queries:
   - Fields:
     * userId (Ascending)
     * timestamp (Descending)
   - Collection Group: activityLogs
   - Query scope: Collection

   ## For action+resource filters:
   - Fields:
     * action (Ascending)
     * resource (Ascending) 
     * timestamp (Descending)
   - Collection Group: activityLogs
   - Query scope: Collection

   ## For error queries:
   - Fields:
     * action (Ascending) (where action == 'error')
     * timestamp (Descending)
   - Collection Group: activityLogs
   - Query scope: Collection

   ## URGENT: Index Required for /logs/action/login

   You're currently seeing this error because the query is trying to filter by `action='login'` and sort by `timestamp` at the same time, which requires a composite index.

## Enterprise Invoices Index (REQUIRED for /billing/invoices endpoint)

   ## For enterprise invoice queries:
   - Fields:
     * enterpriseId (Ascending)
     * date (Descending)
   - Collection Group: enterpriseInvoices
   - Query scope: Collection

   This index is required for the /billing/invoices endpoint to work properly.
   Without this index, the endpoint will use a fallback query but performance will be degraded.

   Create this index at: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/xscard-addd4/firestore/indexes

   Steps to fix:

   1. Open this exact URL in your browser:
      https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/xscard-addd4/firestore/indexes?create_composite=ClFwcm9qZWN0cy94c2NhcmQtYWRkZDQvZGF0YWJhc2VzLyhkZWZhdWx0KS9jb2xsZWN0aW9uR3JvdXBzL2FjdGl2aXR5TG9ncy9pbmRleGVzL18QARoKCgZhY3Rpb24QARoNCgl0aW1lc3RhbXAQAhoMCghfX25hbWVfXxAC

   2. This will open a pre-filled form to create the required index. Click "CREATE INDEX" to create it.

   3. Wait 3-5 minutes for the index to be built. Firebase will show status as "Building" during this time.

   4. Once the index status changes to "Ready", your query will start working.

   ## URGENT: Index Required for /logs/resource/user

   You're currently seeing this error because the query is trying to filter by `resource='user'` and sort by `timestamp` at the same time, which requires a composite index.

   Steps to fix:

   1. Open this exact URL in your browser:
      https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/xscard-addd4/firestore/indexes?create_composite=ClFwcm9qZWN0cy94c2NhcmQtYWRkZDQvZGF0YWJhc2VzLyhkZWZhdWx0KS9jb2xsZWN0aW9uR3JvdXBzL2FjdGl2aXR5TG9ncy9pbmRleGVzL18QARoMCghyZXNvdXJjZRABGg0KCXRpbWVzdGFtcBACGgwKCF9fbmFtZV9fEAI

   2. This will open a pre-filled form to create the required index. Click "CREATE INDEX" to create it.

   3. Wait 3-5 minutes for the index to be built. Firebase will show status as "Building" during this time.

   4. Once the index status changes to "Ready", your query will start working.

   ## URGENT: Index Required for /logs/user/{userId}

   You're currently seeing this error because the query is trying to filter by `userId` and sort by `timestamp` at the same time, which requires a composite index.

   Steps to fix:

   1. Open this exact URL in your browser:
      https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/xscard-addd4/firestore/indexes?create_composite=ClFwcm9qZWN0cy94c2NhcmQtYWRkZDQvZGF0YWJhc2VzLyhkZWZhdWx0KS9jb2xsZWN0aW9uR3JvdXBzL2FjdGl2aXR5TG9ncy9pbmRleGVzL18QARoKCgZ1c2VySWQQARoNCgl0aW1lc3RhbXAQAhoMCghfX25hbWVfXxAC

   2. This will open a pre-filled form to create the required index. Click "CREATE INDEX" to create it.

   3. Wait 3-5 minutes for the index to be built. Firebase will show status as "Building" during this time.

   4. Once the index status changes to "Ready", your query will start working.

3. Alternative Approach - Quick Index Creation:
   
   When you see an error message like:
   
   "The query requires an index. You can create it here: https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/xscard-addd4/firestore/indexes?create_composite=..."
   
   Simply click on the URL in the error message to be taken directly to the index creation page.

4. Wait for Index Creation:
   
   After creating an index, it may take a few minutes to become active. Firebase will show
   the status of the index as "Building" until it's ready to use.

Note: These indexes are required because Firestore requires composite indexes whenever 
you combine filtering on one field with ordering on another field in your queries.
