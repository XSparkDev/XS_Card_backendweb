Analyze and document all enterprise features from the codebase
5. Data Export System (exportController.js)
Export Capabilities:
exportTeams: Exports team data to CSV format

Cache Management Routes: Admin routes for cache monitoring and control
Billing Routes: Enterprise invoicing and demo request endpoints
Export Routes: Data export endpoints for various entity types
Security & Authentication:
authenticateUser Middleware: All routes protected by authentication
Enterprise-level Authorization: Users can only access their associated enterprise data
Role-based Access: Different permissions for different user roles
Analyze and document all enterprise features from the codebase
7. Testing & Quality Assurance (Enterprise_Contact_Aggregation_System.postman_collection.json)
Comprehensive Test Suite:
Performance Testing: Tests cache miss vs cache hit scenarios (5-10 seconds vs 0.01 seconds)
Load Testing: Multiple concurrent requests to test system resilience
Cache Invalidation Testing: Verifies cache is properly cleared when data changes
Functional Testing: Tests all CRUD operations across all entities
